The Document Processing and Analysis System is a sophisticated enterprise solution designed to streamline and secure document management workflows, particularly focusing on the handling of sensitive PDF documents and their textual content analysis. At its core, the system addresses the critical need for secure document transmission and processing in modern business environments by implementing military-grade AES encryption for ZIP files, ensuring that confidential documents remain protected throughout their journey through the system.


When a user submits an encrypted ZIP file, the system's ZipService component springs into action, utilizing a secure password mechanism to decrypt and extract PDF documents. This extraction process is carefully managed within temporary directories, implementing proper security measures to prevent unauthorized access. The system's architecture ensures that all temporary files are handled securely and cleaned up appropriately after processing.




Once a PDF is successfully extracted, the system employs advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to transform the document's content into machine-readable text. This processed text undergoes detailed analysis, including comprehensive word counting and identification of frequently occurring terms, providing valuable insights into document content. The system tracks various metadata points including file sizes, processing timestamps, and reference numbers, creating a complete audit trail of document processing.




All this valuable information is persistently stored in a carefully designed MySQL database schema, which maintains document metadata, processing results, and extracted content. The database structure supports efficient querying and retrieval of document information while handling large text content through appropriate data types like MEDIUMTEXT for OCR content and TEXT for analyzed word data.




The entire system is built on the robust Spring Boot framework, incorporating professional software development practices such as comprehensive error handling and detailed logging through SLF4J. Every operation, from file reception to final storage, is meticulously logged, providing clear audit trails and facilitating system monitoring and debugging. The service layer is designed with clear separation of concerns, making the system both maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.
