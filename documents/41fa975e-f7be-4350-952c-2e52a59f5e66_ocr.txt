Recent security breaches in the West Pacific sector have been linked to unauthorized access of classified

data. Security experts are currently reviewing all recent transmissions originating from the region.

Satellite images reveal unusual activity in a remote area of the South China Sea. The facility—code-named
Specter Base—appears to be operational, though satellite reconnaissance remains inconclusive. Efforts are
underway to secure deeper reconnaissance with the deployment of enhanced drones.

In a separate development, the agency’s psychological operations division has reported success in disorienting
foreign leaders. Subtle psychological manipulation, based on data gathered through covert surveillance,

has

proven to be an effective tool. Through disinformation and subtle nudges, we have successfully sown
confusion

and distrust among rival power structures. However, there is a growing concern that these methods may
backfire

if the opposition adapts too quickly. Early countermeasures suggest that some groups are beginning

to counteract

these efforts with a mix of their own psychological warfare.

Not all clandestine missions proceed without significant setbacks. During the execution of Operation Dagger,
several operatives were compromised when their cover identities were uncovered. This breach led to the
unfortunate

loss of valuable intelligence, but further analysis is ongoing to determine whether the mission can still be
salvaged. The retrieval of compromised assets remains an active priority for extraction teams.

In light of these challenges, a new directive has been issued from Command: Operation Chimera. The objective
is twofold: reinforce current intelligence channels while expanding into uncharted territories where rival
intelligence operations are suspected of gathering strength. Agents in the field have been briefed to report
back with minimal details to reduce the risk of exposure. Direct communications are to be made via secure
channels, and all physical records are to be stored in encrypted data vaults for review. We expect that this
operation will trigger heightened surveillance by foreign entities. An immediate counter-surveillance protocol
has been enacted to prevent any detection.
