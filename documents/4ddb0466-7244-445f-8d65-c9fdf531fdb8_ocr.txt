Operation Blackout continues to yield unprecedented results, though the cost of
maintaining operational secrecy has increased. The infiltration of a prominent
international financial institution, codenamed Crimson Nexus, has allowed us to
manipulate global markets with minimal detection. However, recent intelligence
suggests that rival nations are beginning to catch on to our techniques. A series

of untraceable transactions has been detected across multiple countries, prompting
a need for heightened operational security.

The success of Project Seraphim, while promising, remains shrouded in uncertainty.
Our initial findings suggest that the technology involved could revolutionize
surveillance systems, allowing agents to operate with complete invisibility under
electromagnetic spectrums. However, a series of experimental failures has led to minor
destabilizations in the field. Field operatives have reported intermittent blackouts

and time discrepancies that are difficult to explain. Command has ordered a full

review of the equipment used in these operations, though no official explanation has
been provided for the anomalies.

A new directive from the Director has been issued, known only as Operation Silent Tide.
It involves a coordinated series of maritime-based interventions in contested regions,
where geopolitical tensions are high. The operation is being conducted under the guise
of humanitarian relief, with multiple non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing
cover for our intelligence teams. The true objective is the acquisition of sensitive
underwater data believed to be hidden in sunken vessels near the coast of Greenland.

To date, only minimal traces of the target material have been found, but the potential
strategic value remains immense.
